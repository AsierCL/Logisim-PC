# Computer in logisim

This is a very basic computer created in Logisim Evolution. It only has simple functionalities implemented, which means it can work as a simple calculator with storage.


## Features

The computer is capable of performing ONLY ONE OPERATION PER CYCLE. These operations are divided into 4 groups:

- In-memory data manipulation
- Cached data manipulation
- Saving the ALU result in memory
- Arithmetic operations in the ALU




## Usage

This computer has a simple operation, based on some simple basic rules. 
- The computer allows data to be directly loaded into memory banks and cache memory.
- To operate with two numbers, they must be in the respective caches.
- The only asynchronous element of the computer is the ALU.

## Binary instruction encoding

#### In-memory data manipulation

This type of instruction allows you to modify some of the data stored in the memory banks. The available mods are shift and write.
