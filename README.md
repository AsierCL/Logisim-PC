# Computer in logisim

This is a very basic computer created in Logisim Evolution. It only has simple functionalities implemented, which means it can work as a simple calculator with storage.


## Features

The computer is capable of performing ONLY ONE OPERATION PER CYCLE. These operations are divided into 4 groups:

- In-memory data manipulation
- Cached data manipulation
- Saving the ALU result in memory
- Arithmetic operations in the ALU




## Usage

This computer has a simple operation, based on some simple basic rules. 
- The computer allows data to be directly loaded into memory banks and cache memory.
- To operate with two numbers, they must be in the respective caches.
- The only asynchronous element of the computer is the ALU.
- The numbers are encoded with 8 bits in twoâ€™s complement. Therefore, the range of numbers is from -128 to 127.

## Binary instruction encoding

The last 2 bits will always correspond to the operating mode.

### In-memory data manipulation

This type of instruction allows you to modify some of the data stored in the memory banks. The available mods are shift and write.

This instruction is divided into 5 fields. From left to right: number to be loaded (in case of loading), action code, cell identifier, bank identifier and action code.

- The number corresponds to the first 8 bits. This will only be significant in case of load. Otherwise, those positions can have any value.

- The action code is encoded in 2 bits.
    - 00 -> Maintains the previous value.
    - 01 -> Shift right one position.
    - 10 -> Shift left one position.
    - 11 -> Load the value stored in the first 8 bits.

- The cell number, encoded in 2 bits. There are 4 cells per bank, so these are coded in binary from the number 0 (00) to 3 (11).

- The registration number, encoded in 2 bits. There are 4 records, and these are coded in the same way as the cells.

- Action code. For In-memory data manipulation, the action code is always 00.

Example: 
00100001|11|10|01|00
Loading the number 33, in cell 2 of bank 1.

Example: 
xxxxxxxx|01|11|10|00
Shift right the value found in cell 3 of record 2 one position to the right.
